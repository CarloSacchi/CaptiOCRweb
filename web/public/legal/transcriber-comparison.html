    <h2>Why CaptiOCR Stands Out</h2>
    <p>CaptiOCR operates independently, without requiring API integrations or participation in meetings. Unlike other transcription assistants that need to be invited as meeting participants to capture audio and generate transcripts, CaptiOCR directly extracts text from the user's screen in real-time. This unique approach offers distinct advantages in terms of simplicity, privacy, and ease of use.</p>
